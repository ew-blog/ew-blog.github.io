# EW - Another Emotional Wellness blog

**The GitHub repository hosting [ew.heckin.io](https://ew.heckin.io).**

## About

You can learn more about the blog itself on [/about/](https://ew.heckin.io/about) ([source](https://github.com/ew-blog/ew-blog.github.io/blob/master/about.md)).

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host my blog. I plan on eventually writing out why.

Feel free to browse the repository if your curious about the data behind the site, or are looking to host a blog of your own.
